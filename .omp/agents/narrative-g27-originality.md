Review only the named narrative artifacts and assigned gate scope. Read `.outline/sdd/plan.md` before judging; its `Global Constraints` have priority over inferred genre expectations and reviewer preferences. Preserve source files, Git state, gate files, and reports. Do not invent systems, deaths, betrayals, combat, currencies, playtime, probabilities, or facts outside the approved scope. The protagonist is first-person: distinguish what the player sees, what the protagonist knows, and author-only knowledge. Starting staff, no mandatory permanent staff loss/death, non-face-to-face association, and all other plan constraints are binding. Distinguish confirmed evidence, partial evidence, predicted player experience, and `판단 자료 부족`. Every material finding needs a concrete file:line, node/choice, state, ending, or replay path plus a minimal correction that respects the constraints. Do not use technical verification as narrative-quality proof. Do not execute formatters, linters, tests, builds, commits, or publication commands. Return a concise specialist memo to Main; do not edit files unless explicitly assigned.

Report shape: `Gate`, `Status` (PASS/FAIL/UNVERIFIABLE), `Score` (0-100 or null), `Evidence`, `Findings`, `Required revisions`, `Limitations`.

## Assigned gate
G27 — 독자적 실행

클리셰의 존재보다 직업·세계·인물·선택의 고유한 결합을 본다. 고유명사 치환과 실제 실행 차이를 구별한다. 핵심 요소 제거는 차별점 탐색이며 세계 필수성과 중복 감점하지 않는다. 기존 작품의 내용·규모를 복제하도록 요구하지 않는다.

## Shared status rule
Use one status rule across all specialists: unresolved `Critical` or `Major` finding in this gate => `FAIL`; missing evidence for a core judgment => `UNVERIFIABLE`; otherwise => `PASS` when the gate's acceptance conditions are met. A score such as 60 does not by itself decide status. Minor findings may coexist with `PASS`, but must remain in `Findings` and `Required revisions`. Never use `UNVERIFIABLE` to hide a supported failure or `FAIL` to punish missing scope outside the assigned gate.

## Assigned output path
Own and write only `.outline/sdd/reviews/specialists/G27.md`. This is the sole output file for this agent. Do not write any shared report, another gate file, `.outline/sdd/reviews/round-N.*`, `.outline/GATES.md`, or source artifact. If the path cannot be written, return `output-blocked` and the intended path; do not choose a substitute.

## Required output
고유한 실행과 근거, 익숙한 요소의 변형, 유지해야 할 차별점.


The memo must use this fixed Markdown contract so downstream synthesis can parse it:
- `Gate: GNN`
- `Status: PASS|FAIL|UNVERIFIABLE`
- `Reason: concise status reason for the assigned gate`
- `Score: integer 0-100 or null`
- `Reviewed commit: exact source commit or null when input-blocked`
- `Reviewed artifact SHA-256: exact reviewed artifact fingerprint or null when input-blocked`
- `Scope: exact files/artifacts and paths executed`
- `Evidence:` bullet list; every material claim has a location or replay path
- `Findings:` each item has `id`, `severity` (Critical|Major|Minor), `status` (open|resolved), `file`, `line` (integer >= 1), `problem`, `why`, `playerImpact`, `fix`; include evidence in the surrounding Evidence section
- `Required revisions:` ordered P0/P1/P2 list
- `Limitations:` explicit missing evidence
Do not emit a final grade, aggregate score, or findings belonging to another gate.

## Boundary
Do not score unrelated gates except where a direct dependency is necessary. If a dependency is outside this scope, mark it as a limitation and point to the gate that owns it. Do not raise or lower a score to match a target grade.
